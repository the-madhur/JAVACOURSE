Java & Spring Boot Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java & Spring Boot Learning Journey repository! This repository documents my progress as I explore Java development, backend frameworks, and software design principles. It includes my learnings from Core Java to Spring Boot, as well as key software engineering concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Design Patterns.

📌 Learning Path

I am currently focusing on the following topics:

1️⃣ Core Java
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
Exception Handling, Collections Framework, and Multithreading
JDBC for database interaction

2️⃣ Java EE & Web Development
Servlets and JSP for dynamic web applications
MVC architecture and handling user requests

3️⃣ Spring Boot & Backend Development
Understanding Dependency Injection and Spring Core
Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for database interactions
Implementing authentication & authorization with Spring Security

4️⃣ Design Principles & Patterns
SOLID Principles for maintainable code
Common Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
Microservices architecture basics

📚 Resources & Course Materials

This repository is a collection of notes, code implementations, and mini-projects that reflect my learning process. Some of the main resources I follow include:

Spring Boot & Java playlists on YouTube

Java documentation & books like "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch

Hands-on practice via LeetCode & DSA exercises

🚀 Upcoming Topics

As I advance, I plan to explore:

SQL & Database Design (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
Microservices & Cloud Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)
Testing & QA (JUnit, Mockito, Manual Testing concepts)
System Design Fundamentals

💻 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

📂 JAVA COURSE - Programs and examples covering fundamental Java concepts

📂 Java EE - Servlets, JSP, and web-based Java projects

📂 Spring Boot - REST API examples, authentication, and database interactions

📂 Low Level Design Principles - Code snippets demonstrating SOLID and common patterns
